Lil Wayne, we take a look back on Benny’s journey and what brought him from taking over the underground to being one of the most prominent voices of real hip hop in the main stream. The path wasn’t easy and required years of struggle and sacrifice but with his knowledge and skills acquired from his trapping days, Benny was sure of one thing: good product sells itself. This kept him resilient against the naysayers who doubted him for a list of reason whether it being his age, genre, location etc. Benny The Butcher’s story is a true testament to where passion and dedication can take you.\n\nYou can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.

We’re here to bring some levity into your life so we brought in our good friend Neal Brennan for today’s episode (Yes, the co-writer of the Chappelle Show). We start with music and global politics which quickly transitions into conspiracy theories. Where we cover Bill Cosby, the pandemic and of course the moon landing. Neal then shares with us his life changing experiences with ayahuasca and DMT. He goes into detail about how those experiences have altered his relationships with people and religion. He even provides some insight into his next special. We all share drug stories (cue Rory’s sound journey). We discuss the state of comedy. More specifically, comedic movies and In Living Color/SNL. Neal then shares when he and Dave Chapelle reconnected after their falling out. We collectively laugh at Rory’s trauma. Neal goes on to share his favorite memories with Kobe, Mike Myers, and other legends. Fortunately this conversation coincided with our first voicemail about the illuminati. Tune in as the guys and Neal discuss all of this + more!\n\nFollow The Team:\n\nRory - https://www.instagram.com/thisisrory/\n\nMal - https://www.instagram.com/mal_bytheway/\n\nEddin - https://www.instagram.com/thankyoueddin/\n\nJulian - https://www.instagram.com/julian__nicholas/\n\nDemaris - https://www.instagram.com/demarisagiscombe/\n\nMerch: https://newrorynmal.com/\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/newrorynmal\n\nYouTube Subscribe: https://rb.gy/hk7up",

We reminisce on Rory’s first big break on a wild MTV show. Then we recap our Halloween weekend and share our costumes. Shoutout to ‘You Should Know’ Podcast (episode available on Patreon). Should Kai Cenat have done that “prison” stream? And since when has Keith Lee’s opinion mattered more than any politician? We discover who on the team leaves Yelp reviews. Speaking of reviews, would you leave a comment on your girl’s Only Fans page? Back to music, Flava Flav might have the voice of an angel. Somehow this leads to a conversation about which one of us would go to war. Then we lend our condolences to Matthew Perry. Today, we’re also joined by a special guest Pete Buttigieg (yes, that Pete Buttigieg). He’s currently the Secretary of Transportation and here to cover Rory’s outstanding parking tickets.

Mal asks one of the most odd questions about alzheimer\\'s ever. Then we discuss getting hard at inopportune times. Demaris shares some tough news for Rory regarding his shower(head).

The threats on her life have become so persistent that her security team once installed facial recognition software at the venues she performed in, specifically to distinguish her stalkers from her fans. While making some of the most recognizable pop songs in music history, Taylor Swift also became one of the most recognizable women in the celebrity sphere – a title that on many occasions has nearly cost her life.\nThis episode contains themes that may be disturbing to some listeners, including descriptions of stalking and sexual assault.\nTo see the full list of contributors, see the show notes at www.disgracelandpod.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

He was, however, a master. A master of subtlety and of life lived discreetly. He kept his family history – and his relationship to soul legend Marvin Gaye – a secret for decades. When drug dealers and gang members flipped for the Feds and spilled dirt on Wu-Tang Clan, Masta Killa’s name was kept out of their testimony. When a music journalist accused him of assault, he denied it. And when he finally released his solo debut, more than a decade after Wu-Tang’s debut, it happened at the same time that the feds were deciding whether or not his musical group was also a group of criminals.\n\nTo see the full list of contributors, see the show notes at www.disgracelandpod.com.\nSign up for our newsletter and get the inside dirt on events, merch and other awesomeness - GET THE NEWSLETTER\n\nSupport our Advertising Partners:\n\nFactor: factormeals.com/disgraceland50\nCode: DISGRACELAND50\n\nFum: tryfum.com\nDISGRACELAND\n\nLiquid IV: liquid-iv.com/disgraceland\nCode: DISGRACELAND\n\nNextEvo Naturals: nextevo.com\nCode: DISGRACELAND\n\nPrize Picks: prizepicks.com/DISGRACELAND\nCode: DISGRACELAND\n\nZBiotics: ZBiotics.com/DISGRACELAND \nCode: DISGRACELAND\n\n\nFollow Jake and DISGRACELAND:\n\nInstagram\nYouTube\nX (formerly Twitter) \nFacebook Fan Group\nTikTok\nLearn more about your ad choices.

As there are so many songs by Big Brother and the Holding Company and Janis Joplin excerpted, and Mixcloud won’t allow more than four songs by the same artist in any mix, I’ve had to post the songs not in quite the same order in which they appear in the podcast. But the mixes are here — one, two .\n\nFor information on Janis Joplin I used three biographies -- Scars of Sweet Paradise by Alice Echols, Janis: Her Life and Music by Holly George-Warren, and Buried Alive by Myra Friedman.\n\nI also referred to the chapter \\'“Being Good Isn’t Always Easy\": Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Dusty Springfield, and the Color of Soul\\' in Just Around Midnight: Rock and Roll and the Racial Imagination by Jack Hamilton.\n\nSome information on Bessie Smith came from Bessie Smith by Jackie Kay, a book I can\\'t really recommend given the lack of fact-checking, and Bessie by Chris Albertson. I also referred to Blues Legacies and Black Feminism: Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday by Angela Y. Davis\n\nAnd the best place to start with Joplin\\'s music is this five-CD box, which contains both Big Brother and the Holding Company albums she was involved in, plus her two studio albums and bonus tracks.\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon.

If those subjects are likely to cause you upset, you may want to check the transcript or skip this one rather than listen.\n\nAlso, a subject I should probably say a little more about in this intro because I know I have inadvertently caused upset to at least one listener with this in the past. When it comes to Janis Joplin, it is *impossible* to talk about her without discussing her issues with her weight and self-image.\n\nThe way I write often involves me paraphrasing the opinions of the people I\\'m writing about, in a mode known as close third person, and sometimes that means it can look like I am stating those opinions as my own, and sometimes things I say in that mode which *I* think are obviously meant in context to be critiques of those attitudes can appear to others to be replicating them. At least once, I have seriously upset a fat listener when talking about issues related to weight in this manner.\n\nI\\'m going to try to be more careful here, but just in case, I\\'m going to say before I begin that I think fatphobia is a pernicious form of bigotry, as bad as any other form of bigotry. I\\'m fat myself and well aware of how systemic discrimination affects fat people. I also think more generally that the pressure put on women to look a particular way is pernicious and disgusting in ways I can\\'t even begin to verbalise, and causes untold harm. If *ANYTHING* I say in this episode comes across as sounding otherwise, that\\'s because I haven\\'t expressed myself clearly enough. Like all people, Janis Joplin had negative characteristics, and at times I\\'m going to say things that are critical of those. But when it comes to anything to do with her weight or her appearance, if *anything* I say sounds critical of her, rather than of a society that makes women feel awful for their appearance, it isn\\'t meant to.\n\nAnyway, on with the show.\n\nOn January the ninete"

To be clear, ? and the Mysterians were Latino.\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nNo Mixcloud this week, as there are too many songs by Aretha Franklin. Even splitting it into multiple parts would have required six or seven mixes.\n\n\n\nMy main biographical source for Aretha Franklin is Respect: The Life of Aretha Franklin by David Ritz, and this is where most of the quotes from musicians come from.\n\n\n\nInformation on C.L. Franklin came from Singing in a Strange Land: C. L. Franklin, the Black Church, and the Transformation of America by Nick Salvatore.\n\n\n\nCountry Soul by Charles L Hughes is a great overview of the soul music made in Muscle Shoals, Memphis, and Nashville in the sixties. Peter Guralnick’s Sweet Soul Music: Rhythm And Blues And The Southern Dream Of Freedom is possibly less essential, but still definitely worth reading.\n\n\n\nInformation about Martin Luther King came from Martin Luther King: A Religious Life by Paul Harvey.\n\n\n\nI also referred to Burt Bacharach\\'s autobiography Anyone Who Had a Heart, Carole King\\'s autobiography A Natural Woman, and Soul Serenade: King Curtis and his Immortal Saxophone by Timothy R. Hoover.\n\n\n\nFor information about Amazing Grace I also used Aaron Cohen\\'s 33 1/3 book on the album. The film of the concerts is also definitely worth watching.\n\n\n\nAnd the Aretha Now album is available in this five-album box set for a ludicrously cheap price. But it’s actually worth getting this nineteen-CD set with her first sixteen Atlantic albums and a couple of bonus discs of demos and outtakes.

This episode contains some moderate references to domestic abuse, death by cancer, racial violence, police violence, and political assassination. Anyone who might be upset by those subjects might want to check the transcript rather than listening to the episode.\n\n\n\nAlso, as with the previous episode on Aretha Franklin, this episode presents something of a problem. Like many people in this narrative, Franklin\\'s career was affected by personal troubles, which shaped many of her decisions. But where most of the subjects of the podcast have chosen to live their lives in public and share intimate details of every aspect of their personal lives, Franklin was an extremely private person, who chose to share only carefully sanitised versions of her life, and tried as far as possible to keep things to herself.\n\n\n\nThis of course presents a dilemma for anyone who wants to tell her story -- because even though the information is out there in biographies, and even though she\\'s dead, it\\'s not right to disrespect someone\\'s wish for a private life.

All the surviving live recordings by Dylan and the Hawks from 1966 are on this box set.\n\nThere are various deluxe versions of Music From Big Pink, but still the best way to get the original album is in this twofer CD with the Band\\'s second album.\n\nTranscript\n\nJust a brief note before I start – literally while I was in the middle of recording this episode, it was announced that Robbie Robertson had died today, aged eighty. Obviously I\\'ve not had time to alter the rest of the episode – half of which had already been edited – with that in mind, though I don\\'t believe I say anything disrespectful to his memory. My condolences to those who loved him – he was a huge talent and will be missed.\n\nThere are people in the world who question the function of criticism. Those people argue that criticism is in many ways parasitic. If critics knew what they were talking about, so the argument goes, they would create themselves, rather than talk about other people\\'s creation. It\\'s a variant of the \"those who can\\'t, teach\" cliche.\n\nAnd to an extent it\\'s true. Certainly in the world of rock music, which we\\'re talking about in this podcast,"

I can recommend all of these subject to the caveats at the end of the episode.\n\nThe information on the history and prehistory of the Delta blues mostly comes from Before Elvis by Larry Birnbaum, with some coming from Charley Patton by John Fahey.\n\nThe information on Cream comes mostly from Cream: How Eric Clapton Took the World by Storm by Dave Thompson. I also used Ginger Baker: Hellraiser by Ginger Baker and Ginette Baker, Mr Showbiz by Stephen Dando-Collins, Motherless Child by Paul Scott, and  Alexis Korner: The Biography by Harry Shapiro.\n\nThe best collection of Cream\\'s work is the four-CD set Those Were the Days, which contains every track the group ever released while they were together (though only the stereo mixes of the albums, and a couple of tracks are in slightly different edits from the originals).\n\nYou can get Johnson\\'s music on many budget compilation records, as it\\'s in the public domain in the EU, but the double CD collection produced by Steve LaVere for Sony in 2011 is, despite the problems that come from it being associated with LaVere, far and away the best option -- the remasters have a clarity that\\'s worlds ahead of even the 1990s CD version it replaced.\n\nAnd for a good single-CD introduction to the Delta blues musicians and songsters who were Johnson\\'s peers and inspirations, Back to the Crossroads: The Roots of Robert Johnson, compiled by Elijah Wald as a companion to his book on Johnson, can\\'t be beaten, and contains many of the tracks excerpted in this episode.\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon.

Note that the digital version of the album as sold by Amazon for some reason doesn\\'t include the last disc -- if you want the full box set you have to buy a physical copy. All four studio albums have also been released and rereleased many times over in different configurations with different numbers of CDs at different price points -- I have used the \"45th Anniversary Super-Deluxe\" versions for this episode, but for most people the standard CD versions will be fine.

Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\n\nBefore I begin this episode, there are a few things to say. This introductory section is going to be longer than normal because, as you will hear, this episode is also going to be longer than normal.\n\nFirstly, I try to warn people about potentially upsetting material in these episodes. But this is the first episode for 1968, and as you will see there is a *profound* increase in the amount of upsetting and disturbing material covered as we go through 1968 and 1969.

Ribowsky is usually a very good, reliable, writer, but in this case there are a couple of lapses in editing which make it not a book I can wholeheartedly recommend, but the research on the biographical details of Redding seems to be the best.\n\nInformation about Stax comes primarily from two books: Soulsville USA: The Story of Stax by Rob Bowman, and Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion by Robert Gordon.\n\nCountry Soul by Charles L Hughes is a great overview of the soul music made in Muscle Shoals, Memphis, and Nashville in the sixties.\n\nThere are two Original Album Series box sets which between them contain all the albums Redding released in his life plus his first few posthumous albums, for a low price.

Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\n\nA quick note before I begin -- this episode ends with a description of a plane crash, which some people may find upsetting. There\\'s also a mention of gun violence.\n\nIn 2019 the film Summer of Soul came out. If you\\'re unfamiliar with this film, it\\'s a documentary of an event, the Harlem Cultural Festival, which gets called the \"Black Woodstock\" because it took place in the summer of 1969, overlapping the weekend that Woodstock happened. That event was a series of weekend free concerts in New York, performed by many of the greatest acts in Black music at that time -- people like Stevie Wonder, David Ruffin, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, the Staple Singers, Sly and the Family Stone, Nina Simone, and the Fifth Dimension.\n\nOne thing that that film did was to throw into sharp relief a lot of the performances we\\'ve seen over the years by legends of white rock music of the same time. If you watch the film of Woodstock, or the earlier Monterey Pop festival, it\\'s apparent that a lot of the musicians are quite sloppy. This is easy to dismiss as being a product of the situation -- they\\'re playing outdoor venues, with no opportunity to soundcheck, using primitive PA systems, and often without monitors. Anyone would sound a bit sloppy in that situation, right?\n\nThat is until you listen to the performances on the Summer of Soul soundtrack. The performers on those shows are playing in the same kind of circumstances, and in the case of Woodstock literally at the same time, so it\\'s a fair comparison, and there really is no comparison.\n\nWhatever you think of the quality of the *music* (and some of my very favourite artists played at Monterey and Woodstock), the *musicianship* is orders of magnitude better at the Harlem Cultural Festival\n\n[Excerpt: Gladys Knight and the Pips “I Heard it Through the Grapevine (live)”]\n\nAnd of course there\\'s a reason for this. Most of the people who played at those big hippie festivals had not had the same experiences as the Black musicians. The Black players were mostly veterans of the chitlin\\' circuit, where you had to play multiple shows a day, in front of demanding crowds who wanted their money\\'s worth, and who wanted you to be able to pl"

Sadly, though, none of those are in print. However, at the time of writing there is a new four-CD super-deluxe box set of Headquarters (with a remixed version of the album rather than the original mixes I\\'ve excerpted here) available from that site, and I used the liner notes for that here. Monkees.com also currently has the intermittently-available BluRay box set of the entire Monkees TV series, which also has Head and 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee.\n\nFor those just getting into the group, my advice is to start with this five-CD set, which contains their first five albums along with bonus tracks.\n\nThe single biggest source of information I used in this episode is the first edition of Andrew Sandoval’s The Monkees; The Day-By-Day Story. Sadly that is now out of print and goes for hundreds of pounds. Sandoval released a second edition of the book in 2021, which I was unfortunately unable to obtain, but that too is now out of print. If you can find a copy of either, do get one.\n\nOther sources used were Monkee Business by Eric Lefcowitz, and the autobiographies of three of the band members and one of the songwriters — Infinite Tuesday by Michael Nesmith, They Made a Monkee Out of Me by Davy Jones, I’m a Believer by Micky Dolenz, and Psychedelic Bubble-Gum by Bobby Hart.\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon. Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\n\nWhen we left the Monkees, they were in a state of flux. To recap what we covered in that episode, the Monkees were originally cast as actors in a TV show, and consisted of two actors with some singing ability -- the former child stars Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz -- and two musicians who were also competent comic actors, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork.  The show was about a fictional band whose characters shared names with their actors, and there had quickly been two big hit singles, and two hit albums, taken from the music recorded for the TV show\\'s soundtrack.\n\nBut this had caused problems for the actors. The records were being promoted as being by the fictional group in the TV series, blurring the line between the TV show and reality, though in fact for the most part they were being made by session musicians with only Dolenz or Jones adding lead vocals to pre-recorded backing tracks. Dolenz and Jones were fine with this, but Nesmith, who had been allowed to write and produce a few album tracks himself, wanted more creative input, and more importantly felt that he was being asked to be complicit in fraud because the records credited the four Monkees as the musicians when (other than a tiny bit of inaudible rhythm guitar by Tork on a couple of Nesmith\\'s tracks) none of them played on them.\n\nTork, meanwhile, believed he had been promised that the group would be an actual group -- that they would all be playing on the records together -- and felt hurt and annoyed that this wasn\\'t the case. They were by now playing live together to promote the series and the records, with Dolenz turning out to b"

The story over the last ten episodes or so has been about how the Monterey Pop Festival precipitated an end to LA\\'s dominance in music on the West Coast of the US, and how it was replaced by San Francisco. There will of course be LA artists turning up over the next thirty-odd episodes, especially as we see the Laurel Canyon scene, which is a separate but connected thing to the pop scene, take off towards the end of the sixties.\n\nWe haven\\'t seen the last of several of the artists from LA we\\'ve already looked at, but here and in the next episode we\\'re going to look at the last gasps of the scene that had built up around Sunset Strip and the Hollywood recording studios, the one that encompassed proto-punk garage rock, jangly folk-rock, and modern jazz style harmonies. The influence of that scene would reverberate for decades to come, but the scene itself was largely at an end by the middle of 1967.\n\nThis episode is an unusual one in some respects, because we\\'re looking at a band who we *have* seen previously, but who haven\\'t had an episode to themselves. Normally, when we\\'ve seen a band before, I\\'d just do a \"when we last saw X\" intro, but while about half an hour in the middle of the episode on \"Hey Joe\" was devoted to Love, and to how the band formed, we left the group before they\\'d even made their first album, and the story was being told in the context specifically of their relationship with that song.\n\nSo I\\'m going to do a brief recap of what we covered there, so some of this may sound a little familiar to you. It\\'ll be a much briefer version of the story than I told there, but will include different details.\n\nThe core of the band that became Love was two Black men born in Memphis, Arthur Lee and Johnny Echols. Both had been neighbours in their very early childhood, but Lee\\'s family had moved away to LA whe"

So nobody has to wait around for another fortnight for a new episode, I thought I\\'d upload some old Patreon bonus episodes to fill the gap. Every year around Christmas the bonus episodes I do tend to be on Christmas songs and so this week I\\'m uploading three of those. These are older episodes, so don\\'t have the same production values as more recent episodes, and are also shorter than more recent bonuses, but I hope they\\'re still worth listening to.\n\n\n\nHello, and welcome to this week\\'s second Patreon bonus episode. I\\'m recording this on December the twenty-third, so whether you hear this before Christmas is largely down to how quickly we can get the main episode edited and uploaded. Hopefully, this is going up on Christmas Eve and you\\'re all feeling appropriately festive.\n\nNormally for the Patreon bonuses in the last week of December I choose a particularly Christmassy record from the time period we\\'re covering in the main podcast -- usually a perennial Christmas hit like something off the Phil Spector Christmas album or the Elvis Christmas album. However, this year we\\'re in the mid sixties, a period when none of the big hits of US or UK Christmas music were released, because it\\'s after the peak of US Christmas music and before the peak of UK Christmas music. There were Christmas albums by people like James Brown, but they weren\\'t major parts of the discography.\n\nSo today, we\\'re going to have a brief run-through of the Beatles\\' Christmas records. These were flexi-discs -- which for those of you who are too young to remember them were records pressed on very, very, thin, cheap plastic, which used to be attached to things like kids\\' comics or cereal boxes as promotional gimmicks -- sent out to members of the group\\'s fan club. In a way, these were the Beatles\\' very own Patreon bonuses, sent out to fans and supporters, and not essential works, but hopefully interesting and fun.\n\nThey very rarely had anything like a full song, being mostly made up of sketches and recorded messages, and other than a limited-edition vinyl reissue a few years back they\\'ve never been put on general release -- though one song from the discs, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\", *was* released as a B-side of the CD single of \"Free as A Bird\" in 1995:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]\n\nOther than that, the Christmas records remain one of those parts of the Beatles catalogue which have never seen a proper widespread release. The first record was made on October the 17th 1963, at the same recording session as \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", at the instigation of Tony Barrow, the group\\'s publicist, who also came up with a script for the group to depart from:\n\n[Excerpt, the Beatles\\' first Christmas record]\n\nBarrow apparently edited the recording himself, using scissors and tape, and much of that was just taking out the swearing.\n\nIncidentally, I\\'ve seen some American sources talking about the word \"Crimble\" being a word that the Beatles made up themselves, but it\\'s actually a fairly standard bit of Scouse slang. The second Christmas record was recorded at the end of the sessions for Beatles For Sale and was much the same kind of thing, though this time they incorporated sound effects:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beatles\\' Second Christmas Record]\n\nThat was never sent to American fans. Instead, they got a cardboard copy of an edited version of the first record (it\\'s possible to make records out of cardboard, but they can only be played a handful of times). They wouldn\\'t get another Christmas record until 1968, though British fans kept receiving them.\n\nThe third record sees the group parodying other people\\'s hits, including a brief rendition of \"It\\'s the Same Old Song\" interrupted by George Harrison saying they can\\'t sing it because of copyright, and an attempt to sing Barry McGuire\\'"

The music that\\'s most prominent in the UK will have to wait until we get to the seventies for a discussion, but this week and next week in these bonus episodes I\\'ll be looking at a few American Christmas classics:\n\n[Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Here Comes Santa Claus\"]\n\nIf I\\'d been doing these Patreon bonus episodes from the beginning of the podcast, rather than waiting for the first six months or so to do them on a regular basis, I\\'d have covered Gene Autry in one by about the fourth episode. He\\'s someone whose name you\\'ll have heard a lot in the podcast -- he was an influence on all sorts of musicians we\\'ve looked at, in all areas of music. Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Cooke, Hank Ballard, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Fats Domino, and Les Paul all acknowledged him as someone they were trying to imitate in one way or another, and that\\'s just the ones where I\\'ve been able to find clear confirmation.\n\nAutry was not, in any direct sense, a precursor to rock and roll. He didn\\'t make records that included any of the elements that later became prominent in the new music, and he didn\\'t have a rebellious image at all. But from the early 1930s to the early 1950s, he was the single biggest star in country music. He starred in many films, had his own radio show, had a line of comics about him, and he was so popular that even his *horse* had his own radio and TV show. British people from my generation may well remember Champion, The Wonder Horse still being repeated as kids\\' TV in the eighties.\n\nTHAT\\'s how big Gene Autry was, and so it\\'s unsurprising that he influenced pretty much every singer of note in the rock and roll field.\n\nBut he was also, along with Bing Crosby, one of the people who pioneered American secular Christmas music:\n\n[Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\"]\n\nI specify \"American\" secular Christmas music here, because one thing that differs between the US and the UK when it comes to Christmas is the music that\\'s ubiquitous. In the UK, Christmas music mostly means glam rock -- you hear Slade and Wizzard incessantly, and other 70s artists like Mud. In the US, though, it means primarily the music of the forties and fifties -- the music of people like Gene Autry.\n\nAutry started his career as just another country singer, who performed as \"Oklahoma\\'s Yodelling Cowboy\". His early recordings were very much in the style of Jimmie Rodgers, and were very different from his later clean-cut image:\n\n[Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Black Bottom Blues\"]\n\nBut in 1932 he had a hit with a song he wrote, which would soon become a standard of country music, a rather maudlin ballad called \"That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine\":\n\n[Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine\"]\n\nAs a result of that hit, Autry started appearing in films. The first film he appeared in was a serial -- The Phantom Empire -- in which he starred as a singing cowboy who is kidnapped by people from the underground super-science kingdom Murania, descendants of the lost tribe of Mu, and has to help them defend themselves from an evil scientist who wants to steal their radium. It may not surprise you that the writer of the film came up with the plot for it while on nitro"

These are older episodes, so don\\'t have the same production values as more recent episodes, and are also shorter than more recent bonuses, but I hope they\\'re still worth listening to.\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\nWe talked in the last bonus episode about how the American Christmas music canon more or less ends in 1963. One record that just got in under that wire was \"Little Saint Nick\", recorded by the Beach Boys in October 1963 and released in December:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Little Saint Nick\"]\n\nBrian Wilson, the Beach Boys\\' leader, was apparently inspired to write a Christmas song by Phil Spector -- Wilson turned up to at least one of the sessions for the Spector Christmas album, and had briefly played piano during a couple of takes of \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\", although he wasn\\'t actually on the record itself, as Spector decided he wasn\\'t a good enough player.\n\nThe date the Beach Boys recorded their Christmas song, October the twentieth 1963, was actually a historic date for the group. We\\'ll talk about this more in a few weeks\\' time when we next look at the Beach Boys in the main podcast, but they had gone through a bit of a lineup shuffle, and David Marks had played his last gig with the group the night before, while Al Jardine had rejoined the band shortly before that. That meant that this was the first session since their first single at which the Beach Boys were the classic five-person lineup of Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about what happened at that session, as they recorded two backing tracks. One of them became the \"Little Saint Nick\" that was a hit, but they also recorded a track that later became an album track called \"Drive In\":\n\n[Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Drive In\"]\n\nBut there also exists a recording of that backing track, but with the lyrics to \"Little Saint Nick\":\n\n[Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Drive In (Little Saint Nick version)\"]\n\nI\\'ve seen conflicting accounts of how that track came to exist. Some say that they tried both backing tracks with the same lyrics at the original session, and that they then wrote the \"Drive In\" lyrics for the track that didn\\'t make the cut as \"Little Saint Nick\", while others say that they actually sung the \"Little Saint Nick\" lyrics to the \"Drive In\" track as a joke a few months later, long after the original \"Little Saint Nick\" had already come out.\n\nWhichever is the truth, the version of \"Little Saint Nick\" that eventually came out as a single was this one, which became one of the last holiday classics in the US Christmas canon:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Little Saint Nick\"]\n\n\"Little Saint Nick\" is very clearly modelled on an earlier hit by the group, \"Little Deuce Coupe\", and so it makes sense to me that the track that was chosen was the originally intended one, as musically that\\'s quite close to the earlier song.\n\n\"Little Saint Nick\" was only a moderate success on the main chart, but it made number three on Billboard\\'s Christmas Singles chart, which was enough of a success that the group decided the next year to record a full Christmas album. That album included a remixed version of \"Little Saint Nick\", with the backing track stripped down to sound more like the rest of the album\\'s first side, which was rush-recorded with few overdubs.\n\nThat album was recorded in a style that the Beach Boys did quite a bit at that time, with a side for \"the kids\" -- uptempo original songs -- and a side for \"the adults\", with orchestral versions of more traditional Christmas songs, arranged"

Here’s part one and part two.\nThere are not many books about Roy Wood, and I referred to both of the two that seem to exist -- this biography by John van der Kiste, and this album guide by James R Turner. \nI also referred to this biography of Jeff Lynne by van der Kiste, The Electric Light Orchestra Story by Bev Bevan, and Mr Big by Don Arden with Mick Wall. \nMost of the more comprehensive compilations of the Move\\'s material are out of print, but this single-CD-plus-DVD anthology is the best compilation that\\'s in print. This is the one collection of Wood\\'s solo and Wizzard hits that seems currently in print, and for those who want to investigate further, this cheap box set has the last Move album, the first ELO album, the first Wizzard album, Wood\\'s solo Boulders, and a later Wood solo album, for the price of a single CD.\nTranscript\nBefore I start, a brief note. This episode deals with organised crime, and so contains some mild descriptions of violence, and also has some mention of mental illness and drug use, though not much of any of those things. And it\\'s probably also important to warn people that towards the end there\\'s some Christmas music, including excerpts of a song that is inescapable at this time of year in the UK, so those who work in retail environments and the like may want to listen to this later, at a point when they\\'re not totally sick of hearing Christmas records.\nMost of the time, the identity of the party in government doesn\\'t make that much of a difference to people\\'s everyday lives.  At least in Britain, there tends to be a consensus ideology within the limits of which governments of both main parties tend to work. They will make a difference at the margins, and be more or less competent, and more or less conservative or left-wing, more or less liberal or authoritarian, but life will, broadly speaking, continue along much as before for most people. Some will be a little better or worse off, but in general steering the ship of state is a matter of a lot of tiny incremental changes, not of sudden u-turns.\nBut there have been a handful of governments that have made big, noticeable, changes to the structure of society, reforms that for better or worse affect the lives of every person in the country. Since the end of the Second World War there have been two UK governments that made economic changes of this nature. The Labour government under Clement Atlee which came into power in 1945, and which dramatically expanded the welfare state, introduced the National Health Service, and nationalised huge swathes of major industries, created the post-war social democratic consensus which would be kept to with only minor changes by successive governments of both major parties for decades.\nThe next government to make changes to the economy of such a radical nature was the Conservative government which came to power under Margaret Thatcher in 1979, which started the"

The podcast has been keeping to a fortnightly schedule for the last few months, but at this time of year I have commitments to visit family and friends for Christmas and New Year, and I\\'ve learned that when I\\'m away from home I can\\'t record and shouldn\\'t even make the attempt. Also, a lot of people don\\'t have time to listen to new podcasts over the Christmas period.\nSo here\\'s what\\'s going to happen with the podcast between now and the beginning of the year. I\\'m recording a full podcast episode today, and that will be going up either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, depending how long it takes to edit, so two weeks after the last episode, and then there will be a gap for Christmas and New Year. I will be doing Patreon bonuses during that time on a weekly basis as normal -- they take much less recording time than the main episodes, and I can prerecord them in advance -- but the next main episode of the podcast after this week\\'s will go up on Monday the ninth of January, a little less than three weeks after the last one, rather than the normal two. \nHowever, to fill in the gap I\\'m going to put up a few old Patreon bonus episodes over Christmas week. Every year around this time my Patreon bonus episodes tend to be about something seasonal, and so I\\'ll put up a few of the old ones on the main feed for those of you who haven\\'t heard them. These are older bonus episodes, some from four years ago, and so not in the same style as my more recent work, and mostly around ten minutes or so in length, but they\\'ll hopefully be of interest to anyone who is looking for something seasonal to listen to.\nHappy holidays to those who celebrate a winter holiday at this time of year, and my sympathies to those who don\\'t or for whom it\\'s a difficult time for whatever reason. I\\'ll see you in a couple of days for the next proper episode."

I meant to say he co-produced the track for Glen Campbell. Larry Weiss wrote it.\n\nResources\n\nAs so many of the episodes recently have had no Mixcloud due to the number of songs by one artist, I\\'ve decided to start splitting the mixes of the recordings excerpted in the podcasts into two parts. Here\\'s part one and part two.\n\nI\\'ve used quite a few books in this episode. The Small Faces & Other Stories by Uli Twelker and Roland Schmit is definitely a fan-work with all that that implies, but has some useful quotes.\n\nTwo books claim to be the authorised biography of Steve Marriott, and I\\'ve referred to both -- All Too Beautiful by Paolo Hewitt and John Hellier, and All Or Nothing by Simon Spence. Spence also wrote an excellent book on Immediate Records, which I referred to.\n\nKenney Jones and Ian McLagan both wrote very readable autobiographies.\n\nI’ve also used Andrew Loog Oldham’s autobiography Stoned, co-written by Spence, though be warned that it casually uses slurs.\n\nP.P. Arnold\\'s autobiography is a sometimes distressing read covering her whole life, including her time at Immediate.\n\nThere are many, many, collections of the Small Faces\\' work, ranging from cheap budget CDs full of outtakes to hundred-pound-plus box sets, also full of outtakes. This three-CD budget collection contains all the essential tracks, and is endorsed by Kenney Jones, the band\\'s one surviving member.\n\nAnd if you\\'re intrigued by the section on Immediate Records, this two-CD set contains a good selection of their releases.\n\nERRATUM-ISH: I say Jimmy Winston was “a couple” of years older than the rest of the band. This does not mean exactly two, but is used in the vague vernacular sense equivalent to “a few”. Different sources I\\'ve seen put Winston as either two or four years older than his bandmates, though two seems to be the most commonly cited figure.\n\nTranscript\n\nFor once there is little to warn about in this episode, but it does contain some mild discussions of organised crime, arson, and mental illness, and a quoted joke about capital punishment in questionable taste which may upset some.\n\nOne name that came up time and again when we looked at the very early years of British rock and roll was Lionel Bart. If you don\\'t remember the name, he was a left-wing Bohemian songwriter who lived in a communal house-share which at various times was also inhabited by people like Shirley Eaton, the woman who is painted gold at the beginning of Goldfinger, Mike Pratt, the star of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), and Davey Graham, the most influential and innovative British guitarist of the fifties and early sixties.\n\nBart and Pratt had co-written most of the hits of Britain\\'s first real rock and roll star, Tommy Steele:\n\n[Excerpt: Tommy Steele, \"Rock with the Caveman\"]\n\nand then Bart had gone solo as a writer, and written hits like \"Living Doll\" for Britain\\'s *biggest* rock and roll star, Cliff Richard:\n\n[Excerpt: Cliff Richard, \"Living Doll\"]\n\nBut Bart\\'s biggest contribution to rock music turned out not to be the songs he wrote for rock and roll stars, and not even his talent-spotting -- it was Bart who got Steele signed by Larry Parnes, and he also pointed Parnes in the direction of another of his biggest stars, Marty Wilde -- but the opportunity he gave to a lot of child stars in a very non-ro"

I\\'ve only ever seen Marty Balin\\'s name written down, never heard it spoken, and only after recording the episode, during the editing process, did I discover I mispronounce it throughout. It\\'s usually an advantage for the podcast that I get my information from books rather than TV documentaries and the like, because they contain far more information, but occasionally it causes problems like that. My apologies.\n\nAlso a brief note that this episode contains some mentions of racism, antisemitism, drug and alcohol abuse, and gun violence.\n\nOne of the themes we\\'ve looked at in recent episodes is the way the centre of the musical world -- at least the musical world as it was regarded by the people who thought of themselves as hip in the mid-sixties -- was changing in 1967. Up to this point, for a few years there had been two clear centres of the rock and pop music worlds. In the UK, there was London, and any British band who meant anything had to base themselves there. And in the US, at some point around 1963, the centre of the music industry had moved West. Up to then it had largely been based in New York, and there was still a thriving industry there as of the mid sixties. But increasingly the records that mattered, that everyone in the country had been listening to, had come out of LA\n\nSoul music was, of course, still coming primarily from Detroit and from the Country-Soul triangle in Tennessee and Alabama, but when it came to the new brand of electric-guitar rock that was taking over the airwaves, LA was, up until the first few months of 1967, the only city that was competing with London, and was the place to be.\n\nBut as we heard in the episode on \"San Francisco\", with the Monterey Pop Festival all that started to change. While the business part of the music business remained centred in LA, and would largely remain so, LA was no longer the hip place to be. Almost overnight, jangly guitars, harmonies, and Brian Jones hairstyles were out, and feedback, extended solos, and droopy moustaches were in. The place to be was no longer LA, but a few hundred miles North, in San Francisco -- something that the LA bands were not all entirely happy about:\n\n[Excerpt: The Mothers of Invention, \"Who N"

Some of the information has been superseded by newer discoveries, but Chapman is almost unique in people writing about Barrett in that he actually seems to care about the facts and try to get things right rather than make up something more interesting. Crazy Diamond by Mike Watkinson and Pete Anderson is much less reliable, but does have quite a few interview quotes that aren\\'t duplicated by Chapman.\n\nInformation about Joe Boyd comes from Boyd\\'s book White Bicycles.\n\nIn this and future episodes on Pink Floyd I\\'m also relying on Nick Mason\\'s Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd and Pink Floyd: All the Songs by Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin.\n\nThe compilation Relics contains many of the most important tracks from Barrett\\'s time with Pink Floyd, while Piper at the Gates of Dawn is his one full album with them. Those who want a fuller history of his time with the group will want to get Piper and also the box set Cambridge St/ation 1965-1967.\n\nBarrett only released two solo albums during his career. They\\'re available as a bundle here. Completists will also want the rarities and outtakes collection Opel. \n\nERRATA:\n\nI talk about “Interstellar Overdrive” as if Barrett wrote it solo. The song is credited to all four members, but it was Barrett who came up with the riff I talk about.\n\nAnd annoyingly, given the lengths I went to to deal correctly with Barrett\\'s name, I repeatedly refer to \"Dave\" Gilmour, when Gilmour prefers David.\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon. Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\n\nA note before I begin -- this episode deals with drug use and mental illness, so anyone who might be upset by those subjects might want to skip this one.\n\nBut also, there\\'s a rather unique problem in how I deal with the name of the main artist in the story today. The man everyone knows as Syd Barrett was born Roger Barrett, used that name with his family for his whole life, and in later years very strongly disliked being called \"Syd\", yet everyone other than his family called him that at all times until he left the music industry, and that\\'s the name that appears on record labels, including his solo albums.\n\nI don\\'t believe it\\'s right to refer to people by names they choose not to go by themselves, but the name Barrett went by throughout his brief period in the public eye was different from the one he went by later, and by all accounts he was actually distressed by its use in later years. So what I\\'m going to do in this episode is refer to him as \"Roger Barrett\" when a full name is necessary for disambiguation or just \"Barrett\" otherwise, but I\\'ll leave any quotes from other people referring to \"Syd\" as they were originally phrased.\n\nIn future episodes on Pink Floyd, I\\'ll refer to him just as Barrett, but in episodes where I discuss his influence on other artists, I will probably have to use \"Syd Barrett\" because otherwise people who haven\\'t listened to this episode won\\'t know what on Earth I\\'m talking about.\n\nAnyway, on with the show.\n\n“It’s gone!” sighed the Rat"

The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound by Nelson George is an excellent popular history of the various companies that became Motown.\n\nTo Be Loved by Berry Gordy is Gordy’s own, understandably one-sided, but relatively well-written, autobiography.\n\nWomen of Motown: An Oral History by Susan Whitall is a collection of interviews with women involved in Motown.\n\nI Hear a Symphony: Motown and Crossover R&B by J. Andrew Flory is an academic look at Motown.\n\nThe Motown Encyclopaedia by Graham Betts is an exhaustive look at the people and records involved in Motown’s thirty-year history.\n\nHow Sweet It Is by Lamont Dozier and Scott B. Bomar is Dozier’s autobiography, while Come and Get These Memories by Brian and Eddie Holland and Dave Thompson is the Holland brothers’.\n\nStanding in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson by \"Dr Licks\" is a mixture of a short biography of the great bass player, and tablature of his most impressive bass parts.\n\nAnd Motown Junkies is an infrequently-updated blog looking at (so far) the first 694 tracks released on Motown singles.\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon. Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\nA quick note before I begin -- this episode deals with disability and racism, and also deals from the very beginning with sex work and domestic violence.

I\\'ve tried to discuss these things with a reasonable amount of sensitivity, but there\\'s a tabloid element to some of my sources which inevitably percolates through, so be warned if you find those things upsetting. \n\n\n\nOne of the promises I made right at the start of this project was that I would not be doing the thing that almost all podcasts do of making huge chunks of the episodes be about myself -- if I\\'ve had to update people about something in my life that affects the podcast, I\\'ve done it in separate admin episodes, so the episodes themselves will not be taken up with stuff about me. The podcast is not about me.\n\n\n\nI am making a very slight exception in this episode, for reasons that will become clear -- there\\'s no way for me to tell this particular story the way I need to without bringing myself into it at least a little. So I wanted to state upfront that this is a one-off thing. The podcast is not suddenly going to change. \n\n\n\nBut one question that I get asked a lot -- far more than I\\'d expect -- is \"do the people you talk about in the podcast ever get in touch with you about what you\\'ve said?\"\n\n\n\nNow that has actually happened twice, both times involving people leaving comments on relatively early episodes. The first time is probably the single thing I\\'m proudest of achieving with this series, and it was a comment left on the episode on \"Goodnight My Love\" a couple of years back:\n\n\n\n[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin, \"Goodnight My Love\"]\n\n\n\nThat comment was from Debra Frazier and read “Jesse Belvin is my Beloved Uncle, my mother’s brother.

Just so glad someone got it right. I still miss them dearly to this day. My world was forever changed Feb. 6th 1960. I can remember him writing most of those songs right there in my grandmother’s living room.
